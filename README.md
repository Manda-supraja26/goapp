# GoLang Application with Gorilla Mux and MySQL
This is a sample GoLang application that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Gorilla Mux for routing and MySQL for the database. It implements basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources.

## Prerequisites
- Go 
- MySQL 
- Postman (for testing the API endpoints)

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Manda-supraja26/goapp.git
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:
```
go mod tidy
```

- Run the application:
```
go run main.go
```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:

## Testing with Postman
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints. Here's an example of how to test the endpoints:
