 GoLang Application with Gorilla Mux and MySQL
This is a sample GoLang application that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Gorilla Mux for routing and MySQL for the database. It implements basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources.

## Prerequisites
- Go: Ensure you have Go installed (version 1.13 or higher recommended) for development and compilation. 
- MySQL: A running instance of MySQL is required for the database backend.
- Docker: For containerization and easy deployment, Docker should be installed and running.
- Postman: Recommended for testing and interacting with the API endpoints.
- An IDE or text editor of your choice (such as Visual Studio Code, GoLand, or Atom) for writing and editing code.

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Manda-supraja26/goapp.git
