# GoLang Application with Gorilla Mux and MySQL
This is a sample GoLang application that demonstrates how to build a RESTful API using Gorilla Mux for routing and MySQL for the database. It implements basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing resources.

## Prerequisites
- Go 
- MySQL 
- Postman (for testing the API endpoints)

## Getting Started
- Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Manda-supraja26/goapp.git
```

- Install the necessary dependencies:
```
go mod tidy
```

- Run the application:
```
go run main.go
```

The application should now be running on http://localhost:8080.

## API Endpoints

The following API endpoints are available:


Testing with Postman
You can use Postman to test the API endpoints. Here's an example of how to test the endpoints:

Create a new resource:

Method: POST
URL: http://localhost:8080/api/resource
Body: JSON payload representing the resource
Get a resource by ID:

Method: GET
URL: http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}
Update a resource by ID:

Method: PUT
URL: http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}
Body: JSON payload with updated resource data
Delete a resource by ID:

Method: DELETE
URL: http://localhost:8080/api/resource/{id}
